1--- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository sets up the current directory so that you can start
snapshotting files within it. If you don't initialize a repository, you won't be
able to commit files inside of that directory.


2--- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary location for files that you intend to commit,
between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to carefully
select files that would be good to bundle together in a single, cohesive commit.
