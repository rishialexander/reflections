1--- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Remote repositories are great if you're working from multiple computers, or if
you are working with other people.


2--- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If Git automatically stayed up-to-date with the remote repository, it might cause
unexpected behavior if other people are pushing to the repository as well.


3--- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of a repository, either from Github or locally. You would use
this if you want a copy of someone else's project from Github on your computer,
or a copy of your own project from your computer to elsewhere on your computer.
A fork is a special kind of clone: a copy of a repository from one Github account
to another. You would use this if you want to make changes to someone else's
project on Github but you don't have permission to change their repository. A
branch is a different version within a repository. You would use this if you are
making changes to a project that are experimental and not ready to be pushed to
the master branch.
